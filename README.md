# Unity_live_caption
Use Google Speech-to-Text API to do real-time live stream caption on Unity! Best when combined with your virtual character!

The [youtube livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZsUm_cuj9U) that demos and explains how this works (explanation in Chinese, caption in Chinese/Japanese/English/French).

Code and tutorial will come soon.
